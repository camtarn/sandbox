# Yeoman angular generator installs a Compass plugin, but doesn't warn you
# that you'll need a separate Compass gem to use it
sudo gem install sass
sudo gem install compass

# Had issues with yeoman angular generator automatically adding karma to the
# gruntfile, but without actually installing Karma (sigh). Edited gruntfile to
# remove it.

# Had issues with 'ENOENT in file app/images/yeoman.png'. This fixed it:
npm uninstall grunt-contrib-imagemin
npm install grunt-contrib-imagemin
