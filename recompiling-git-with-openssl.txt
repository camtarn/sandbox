sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential dpkg-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libpcre3-dev unzip libexpat1-dev gettext
sudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install asciidoc xmlto
sudo apt-get build-dep git

If apt complains about missing source repo:
sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list
Add deb-src version of main repo if it isn't there

mkdir ~/git-openssl
cd ~/git-openssl
apt-get source git
dpkg-source -x git_1.7.9.5-1.dsc
cd git-1.7.9.5

(Remember to replace 1.7.9.5 with the actual version of git in your system.)

Then, edit debian/control file (run the command: gksu gedit debian/control) and replace all instances of libcurl4-gnutls-dev with libcurl4-openssl-dev.

Then build the package (if it's failing on test, you can remove the line TEST=test from the file debian/rules):

sudo dpkg-buildpackage -b -d

This is as far as I got, because either Git's build scripts are faulty, or I was violating some assumption - either way, there was an invalid command and the whole thing came crashing down, grr.
